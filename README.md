# Better Notes

## About
**Better Notes** is my personal project to learn **C# and WPF** by building a Notepad-like application with additional features. I wanted to recreate a simple and efficient note-taking experience while adding some extra functionality that I personally find useful.

This project is a **work in progress**, and I’m continuously improving it as I learn more about C# and application development.
